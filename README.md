This is the final year project for Team Convolution.

We are trying to build a Reinforcement Learning Agent for the Pong game using Asynchronous Advantage
Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm which has been described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783.pdf).

This code is heavily inspired from the works of [OpenAI/universe-starter-agent](https://github.com/openai/universe-starter-agent) and [Deep-RL agent](https://github.com/awjuliani/DeepRL-Agents/blob/master/A3C-Doom.ipynb). You may go through these codes if you
feel like doing so.

We will be implementating a bit different algorithm in a few days. It will supposedly be a minor modification
to the propsed algorithm.

To run the code, simply type:

python doom.py
